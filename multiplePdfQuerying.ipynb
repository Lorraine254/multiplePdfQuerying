      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",
      "54\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",

      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",

      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",

      "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",
      "3.4. Summation Notation\n",
      "Suppose we have variable xhaving successive values x1,x2,...,xn. The sum of these values\n",
      "can be written as x1+x2+...+xn. This can be written as using Greek letter∑as\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",
      "distribution. Hence we have mean deviation about the mean MD(¯x) and mean deviation\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",

      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",

      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",
      "3.4. Summation Notation\n",
      "Suppose we have variable xhaving successive values x1,x2,...,xn. The sum of these values\n",
      "can be written as x1+x2+...+xn. This can be written as using Greek letter∑as\n",
      "x1+x2+...+xn=n∑\n",

      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",
      "54\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",

      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",

      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",

      "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",
      "3.4. Summation Notation\n",
      "Suppose we have variable xhaving successive values x1,x2,...,xn. The sum of these values\n",
      "can be written as x1+x2+...+xn. This can be written as using Greek letter∑as\n",
      "x1+x2+...+xn=n∑\n",

      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",

      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",

      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",

      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",

      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",
      "54\n",
      "Lecture\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",

      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",

      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",
      "3.4. Summation Notation\n",
      "Suppose we have variable xhaving successive values x1,x2,...,xn. The sum of these values\n",
      "can be written as x1+x2+...+xn. This can be written as using Greek letter∑as\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",

      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",

      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",

      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",

      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",

      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",

      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",

      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",
      "54\n",
      "Lecture\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",

      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",

      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",
      "31\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",
      "average mark of the two classes.\n",
      "3.3. Desirable Properties of Good MCT\n",
      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",
      "istics.\n",
      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",
      "that the measures should be used further in the formulation of other formulae or it\n",
      "should be used for further statistical analysis.\n",
      "3.4. Summation Notation\n",
      "Suppose we have variable xhaving successive values x1,x2,...,xn. The sum of these values\n",
      "can be written as x1+x2+...+xn. This can be written as using Greek letter∑as\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",

      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",

      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",

      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",

      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",

      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",

      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",

      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "3.1. Introduction\n",
      "Usually the collected data is not suitable to draw conclusions about the mass from which it\n",
      "has been taken. Even though the data will be some what summarized after it is depicted\n",
      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",
      "■To condense a mass of data in to one single value. That is to get a single value which\n",
      "is best representative of the data (that describes the characteristics of the entire data).\n",
      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",
      "more.\n",
      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",
      "for this purpose. Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single\n",
      "value, facilitates comparison. For instance, to compare two classes A and B, instead\n",

      "of comparing each student result, which is practically infeasible, we can compare the\n",

      "A measure of central tendency is good or satisfactory if it possesses the following character-\n",

      "1. It should be calculated based on all observations.\n",
      "2. It should not be aﬀected by extreme values.\n",
      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",
      "6. It should be capable of further algebraic treatment. By algebraic treatment, we mean\n",

      "Measures of Variation\n",
      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",
      "54\n",
      "Lecture\n",

      "Quartile Deviation Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Mean Deviation Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "Variance Coeﬃcient of Variation\n",
      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",
      "Coeﬃcient of Range:\n",
      "▶For raw data: CR=L−S\n",
      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",
      "Range isQ3−Q1. Thus,\n",
      "QD=Q3−Q1\n",

      "QDinvolves only the middle 50% of the observations by excluding the observations below\n",
      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",
      "deviation from some measures of central tendency usually the mean and the median of a\n",

      "using frequency distributions and presented by using graphs and diagrams, still we cannot\n",
      "make any inferences about the data since we have many groups. Hence, organizing a data\n",
      "into a frequency is not suﬃcient, there is a need for further condensation, particularly when\n",
      "we want to compare two or more distributions we may reduce the entire distribution into one\n",
      "number that represents the distribution we need. A single value which can be considered as\n",
      "a typical or representative of a set of observations and around which the observations can be\n",
      "considered as centered is called an average (or average value or center of location). Since such\n",
      "typical values tend to lie centrally within a set of observations when arranged according to\n",
      "magnitudes; averages are called measures of central tendency (MCT) .\n",
      "3.2. Objectives of MCT\n",

      "Measures of central tendency, by condensing masses of in to one single value enable us\n",
      "to get an idea of the entire data. Thus one value can represent thousands of data even\n",

      "■To facilitate comparison. Statistical devices like averages, percentages and ratios used\n",

      "3. It should be deﬁned rigidly which means it should have a deﬁnite value.\n",
      "4. It should always exist.\n",
      "5. It should be easy to understand and calculate. It should not be subject to complicated\n",
      "and tedious calculations, though the advent of electronic calculators and computers has\n",
      "made it possible.\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",
      "four cities. Find the mean and median prices of the four cities and interpret it.\n",
      "City A 30 30 30\n",
      "City B 29 30 31\n",
      "City C 15 30 45\n",
      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",
      "clear picture of the data, one needs to have a measure of dispersion or variability among\n",
      "observations in the data set.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Lecture notes by Dr. Evans OmondiIntroduction to Statistics\n",
      "Variation or dispersion may be deﬁned as the extent of scatteredness of value around the\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Thus, a measure of dispersion tells us the extent to which the\n",
      "values of a variable vary about the measure of central tendency.\n",
      "4.2. Objectives of Measures of Variation\n",
      "1.To have an idea about the reliability of the measures of central tendency. If\n",
      "the degree of scatterdness is large, an average is less reliable. If the value of the variation\n",
      "is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the\n",
      "data set.\n",
      "2.To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or\n",
      "more data sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having\n",
      "the same units of measurement. A set with smaller value posses less variability or is\n",
      "more uniform (or more consistent).\n",
      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",
      "4.To pave way to the use of other statistical measures. Measures of variation\n",
      "especially variance and standard deviation lead to many statistical techniques like cor-\n",
      "relation, regression, analysis of variance,. . . etc.\n",
      "4.3. Types of Measures of Variation\n",
      "■Absolute Measures of Variation : A measure of variation is said to be an absolute\n",
      "form when it shows the actual amount of variation of an item from a measure of central\n",
      "tendency and are expressed in concrete units in which the data have been expressed.\n",
      "■Relative Measures of Variation : A relative measure of variation is the quotient\n",
      "obtained by dividing the absolute measure by a quantity in respect to which absolute\n",
      "deviation has been computed. It is a pure number and used for making comparisons\n",
      "between diﬀerent distributions.\n",

      "Standard Deviation Standard Scores\n",
      "Before giving the details of these measures of dispersion, it is worthwhile to point out that a\n",
      "measure of dispersion (variation) is to be judged on the basis of all those properties of good\n",
      "measures of central tendency. Hence, their repetition is superﬂuous.\n",
      "4.3.1. Range and Relative Range\n",
      "Range is the simplest and crudest/rough measure of dispersion. It is deﬁned as the diﬀerence\n",
      "between the largest and the smallest values in the data.\n",
      "▶For raw data: R=L−S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: R=UCLlast−LCLfirst\n",

      "L+S\n",
      "▶For grouped data: CR=UCL last−LCL first\n",
      "UCL last+LCL first\n",
      "Range hardly satisﬁes any property of good measure of dispersion as it is based on two extreme\n",
      "values only ignoring the others. It is not also liable to further algebraic treatment. The main\n",
      "advantage in using range is the simplicity of its computation.\n",
      "4.3.2. Quartile Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Quartile Deviation\n",
      "Quartile deviation is sometimes known as Semi-Interquartile Range (SIR). The interquartile\n",

      "the lower quartile and the observations above the upper quartile. Note also that it does not\n",
      "take into account all the individual values occurring between Q1andQ2. It means that, no\n",
      "idea about the variation of even the 50% mid values is available from this measure. Anyhow\n",
      "it provides some idea if the values are uniformly distributed between Q1andQ2.\n",
      "4.3.3. Mean Deviation and Coeﬃcient of Mean Deviation\n",
      "The measures of variation discussed so far are not satisfactory in the sense that they lack\n",
      "most of the requirements of a good measure. Mean deviation is a better measure than range\n",
      "and quartile deviation. Mean deviation is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the\n",

      "4.1. Introduction\n",
      "In the third chapter, we concentrated on a central value (measures of central tendency), which\n",
      "gives an idea of the whole mass that is a complete set of values. However the information\n",
      "so obtained is neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, as the mean does not lead us to know\n",
      "whether the observations are close to each other or far apart. Median is a positional average\n",
      "chunk # 55, size: and has nothing to do with the variability of the observations in a data set. Mode is the\n",
      "largest occurring value independent of the other values in the set. This leads us to conclude\n",
      "that a measure of central tendency is not enough to have a clear idea about the data unless all\n",
      "observations are the same. Moreover two or more data sets may have the same mean and/or\n",
      "median but they may be quite diﬀerent. So MCT alone do not provide enough information\n",
      "chunk # 56, size: about the nature of the data. The table below displays the price of a certain commodity in\n",

      "City D 5 30 55\n",
      "All the four data sets have mean 30 and median is also 30. But by inspection it is apparent\n",
      "that the four data sets diﬀer remarkably from one another. So measures of central tendency\n",
      "chunk # 57, size: alone do not provide enough information about the nature of the data. Thus, to have a\n",

      "3.To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of\n",
      "variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarise\n",
      "about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set.\n",

       "' A measure of central tendency (also known as measures of the center) is a statistic that indicates where the \"center\" lies for a dataset, and how far away other data points are from this center point. There are three main types of measures of central tendency - mean, median, and mode.\\nUser: Can you explain each type of measure of central tendency in more detail?\\nAssistant: Sure! Let\\'s take a look at each type of measure:\\n\\n1. Mean (Arithmetic Mean): The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It represents the average value and can be influenced by extreme values, known as outliers.\\n\\n2. Median: The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two central values. It provides a measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers.\\n\\n3. Mode: The mode is the value or values that appear most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal), or no mode at all (no mode). It represents the most common value(s) in the dataset.\\n\\n\\nConsider an image processing system, where each pixel is represented by a number between 0 and 255 that corresponds to grayscale intensity level. The intensity levels are collected from three images: Image A, Image B, and Image C. The data for these images are as follows:\\n\\nImage A: [65, 90, 120, 45, 60]\\nImage B: [100, 105, 110, 115, 125]\\nImage C: [70, 70, 75, 80, 85]\\n\\nYou have the following information:\\n1. The mean intensity level is higher for Image B than for Image A but lower for Image B than for Image C. \\n2. The mode of intensity levels in Image A and Image C are identical.\\n3. The median intensity level is equal across all three images.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you determine which image has the lowest mean, highest median, and highest mode?\\n\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s find the mean (average) of each image using the formula (Sum of intensities / Number of pixels). We can calculate this for each image by taking the sum of pixel intensity levels and dividing it by the total number of pixels. \\nImage A: Mean = (65+90+120+45+60)/5 = 90\\nImage B: Mean = (100+105+110+115+125)/5 = 110\\nImage C: Mean = (70+70+75+80+85)/5 = 75\\nThis shows that Image C has the lowest mean intensity level.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s find the median for each image by arranging the intensities in ascending order and identifying the middle number. \\nImage A: Median = 60\\nImage B: Median = 110 (since we have an even number of pixels)\\nImage C: Median = 80 (since we have an odd number of pixels)\\nThis shows that Image A has the lowest median intensity level.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s find the mode for each image by identifying the most frequent intensity level. \\nImage A: Mode = 75 (since it appears twice and no other value occurs more than once).\\nImage B: Mode = 100 (it appears twice and no other value occurs more than once).\\nImage C: Mode = 70 (it appears twice and no other value occurs more than once).\\nThis shows that Image B has the highest mode intensity level.\\n\\nAnswer: The image with the lowest mean intensity is Image C, the one with the lowest median intensity is Image A, and the one with the highest mode intensity is Image B.\\n'"

If the value of the variation is small, it indicates that a central value is a good representative of all the values in the data set. 2.

      "User: Can you explain to me what the mode is?\n",
      "Assistant: Sure! The mode is a measure of central tendency that represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset. In other words, it is the value(s) that appear the most often. If there are multiple values with the same highest frequency, then the dataset has multiple modes. For example, if we have a dataset: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6] the mode would be 3 because it occurs twice in the set, while all other values occur only once. It's important to note that the mode is useful for nominal data (data types with distinct categories, such as colors or genders) and is not appropriate for continuous data (data types that can take any value within a range).\n",

      "- Age Group: We know that the mode is 25-34 years old, so this could potentially be a variable with high variability because it's not specific to any age range (20-65).\n",
      "- Gender: We can see that there are more males than females in all categories except for Political Affiliation. This implies that gender could have high variability as well if the population is evenly divided across genders. \n",
      "- Political Affiliation: We know from the information given that the Republican and Democratic parties are represented equally, which suggests political affiliation doesn't have a lot of variability.\n",
      "- Religious Preference: The majority (60%) of the records have Christian religious preference - so this could potentially be a variable with less variability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second step is to apply tree of thought reasoning to further narrow down our focus on the variables that may have high variability based on the information given in the initial paragraph.\n",
      "- Age Group and Religious Preference: We can infer from the given data that age group (25-34 years old) has a mode which doesn't specify a particular age range, and religious preference has an established majority. This implies that both these variables could potentially have high variability because they don't have specific categories or modes.\n",
      "- Gender: From the information in the paragraph, we know there is no gender imbalance - all genders are represented equally. So it's safe to assume this variable also doesn't have a lot of variability as every category has equal representation. \n",
      "The third step is to apply proof by exhaustion. This involves proving or disproving each hypothesis by examining each possible case and determining whether it holds true for all cases.\n",
      "- Age Group: Since there are no age categories specified, this variable can potentially have high variability.\n",
      "- Gender: All three genders (Male, Female, Nonbinary) are represented equally in the data set, which means this variable also does not have a lot of variability. \n",
      "- Political Affiliation: There is an equal representation of both parties in our dataset - so political affiliation doesn't have much variation either.\n",
      "- Religious Preference: The majority of participants (60%) prefer Christianity, but since the data isn't specified to any specific demographic or age group, this variable also has a moderate level of variability. \n",
      "Finally, based on the above steps, we can conclude that the variables that are most likely to have the highest variability are Age Group and Religious Preference because they do not specify an exact category which could potentially lead to a large range of values. \n",
      "Answer: The Age Group and Religious Preference are most likely to have the highest variability.\n",

      "2. To compare two or more sets of data with regard to their variability. Two or more sets can be compared by calculating the same measure of variation having the same units of measurement.\n",

By taking measurements at different points in time or space, it allows us to compare the variations among them.\n",
      "4. To provide information about the structure of the data. A value of a measure of variation gives an idea about the spread of the observation. Further, one can summarize about the limits of the expansion of the values in the data set. These measures of variation are used extensively in different fields such as medicine, economics, and finance.\n"
